My name is Irshad Allahverdiyev, a 3rd year Medical student at Istanbul University Faculty of Medicine. I am 19, and my interest are Neurology, Neuroscience, Neurosurgery and Machine Learning applications in Medicine. If you do not see me in the Library, I am most likely playing Chess or Table Tennis. My goal is to become a Neurologist and Chess GM (Grandmaster) simultaneously. Currently my Chess ELO is rated between 1300-1500 according to my Live tournament performance. This is the first version of my website and I will try to code the Publications, CV and add Updates very soon. Enjoy!

Why did I create this website?
======
I created a website for my academic updates in neurology and medical school to centralize my learning journey, share insights with peers, stay organized with coursework, showcase my expertise, build a professional portfolio, and contribute to the medical community by fostering collaboration and knowledge exchange.

My goals as a Medical student
======
Coming soon with Photos section!!

Research Interests
------
For the first 2 years of Medical school I worked on the Neuroanatomy of the human brain. Recently, I found out that I have a special interest for AI, ML and GPT applications in Medicine. So, currently I am working on several Machine Learning studies which bring ML and Neurosurgery together.

U.S. experiences
------
I worked as a research intern in Barrow Neurological Institute last summer. During this time I was able to participate in 3 projects (not all of them were in the same Hospital) and 2 of them will be published soon.
