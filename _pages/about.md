My name is Irshad Allahverdiyev, a 3rd year Medical student at Istanbul University Faculty of Medicine. I am 19, and my interest are Neurology, Neuroscience, Neurosurgery and Machine Learning applications in Medicine. If you do not see me in the Library, I am most likely playing Chess or Table Tennis. My goal is to become a Neurologist and Chess GM (Grandmaster) simultaneously. Currently my Chess ELO is rated between 1300-1500 according to my Live tournament performance. This is the first version of my website and I will try to code the Publications, CV and add Updates very soon. Enjoy!

Why did I create this website?
======
I created a website for my academic updates in neurology and medical school to centralize my learning journey, share insights with peers, stay organized with coursework, showcase my expertise, build a professional portfolio, and contribute to the medical community by fostering collaboration and knowledge exchange.
